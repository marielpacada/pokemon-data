# pokemon-data
analyzes pokemon stats across generations, types, etc.

we explore the questions: 
  1. What are some BMI trends in the Pokemon community?
  2. Which type is the strongest overall? Which is the weakest?
  3. Which Pokemon type is the most abundant?
  4. Are Pokemon getting faster/stronger/more resistant?
  5. Is one type more likely to be a legendary than another?

our goal is ultimately to publish these results through visualizations onto a web page using d3 and heroku
